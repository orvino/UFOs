## UFOs Sightings

## Overview
Dana has requested a webpage with a dynamic table that provides more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing user to filer for multiple criteria, such as city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The Truth is Out There - is the title and header of the webpage where the user will land.  There is a brief four paragraphs from ufologists followed by our filter search and results columns.

The webpage defualts to all data shown from our source JSON files that are from the year 2010.

How the filters appear when first landing on the page:


How the filters appear after being used:
By typing in the suggested placeholder elements as the filters, the result returns 2 matches. Make sure to type everything in lower case letters and do not have spaces at the end of the text. Click off the input box or press enter to initiate the filter. To reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.



Summary:
Drawback:
The user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search. Some shapes like "light" might not be as intuitive. The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. The city that was used, for example, could not be typed as "elcajon", “el cajon_”, or "El Cajon". The only acceptable input would be "el cajon".

Recommendations:
The next addition to the filters should be to add a trim function to catch spaces at the end of words as well as allow for upper and lower cases. Pic 4

A filter on a date range might be preferable than a singular date. Typing 1/2010 did not bring up all the dates from January as hoped. Perhaps, the UFO Sightings occur more frequently in a specific month instead of a specific day within the month. It is recommended to add in a filter function to include a date range as the filter to aid in the investigation of UFO Sightings.
